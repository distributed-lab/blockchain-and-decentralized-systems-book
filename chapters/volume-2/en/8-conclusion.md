# CONCLUSION

In this part of the textbook, we appended and expanded the "decentralized technologies map" with the utmost care, described the most significant technological solutions and justified why all of the described concepts are required to build the Financial Internet.

Our goal was to show that the word *blockchain* does not make an accounting system self-sufficient: the system requires the implementation of specific solutions for specific tasks. This is especially true when facing the following tasks: "How to ensure the confidentiality of payments while maintaining the possibility to confirm them in a decentralized environment?", "How to build an effective role-based model for managing permissions?", "How to ensure the integration between two independent accounting systems?", etc. We hope that this book will become the source of their solutions.

At the same time, we tried not to just delve into specific implementations but always describe the key features of the underlying technology and why it works in that particular way. We believe that it is much more important to explain how exactly something works than to dwell in particular specifications. Knowing the operation principles of atomic swaps, you can re-engineer them in a specific accounting system regardless of the other details of its operation.

We do not see the possibility and necessity for revealing the full stack of decentralized technologies within one or two books. Therefore, we have tried to balance the presented material in a way that particular concepts in each book section and paragraph will logically build on the knowledge acquired previously. Only by logically and technically expanding simple concepts, we will be able to build a self-sufficient global system together â€“ the Financial Internet.

The authors are grateful for any helpful comments and constructive suggestions on improving this book. We will carefully consider any suggestions on improving the material, including illustrations, tables, examples, comments on the style, the narrative as well as the supplementary materials included.
