# Conclusion
The topics of blockchain and decentralization are very controversial from the beginning. The industry not only contains 
innovations in computer science, game theory, psychology, investments, and finance but was also flavored with different 
political views. It is very easy to get into a heated discussion with simply mentioning Bitcoin.

Even experienced technologists sometimes miss the point, claiming that blockchain is either a magic pill that will save 
the entire humanity, or that it is no better than the traditional database with its old tricks. Of course, both views 
are far from reality. The aim of this book was to shed the light on the key technological approaches—blockchain and 
tokenization—as well as how to use them for the benefit of people.

The first part of the book is devoted to the study of decentralized accounting systems, mostly using examples of 
technology, invented or applied in cryptocurrency. Therefore, we didn't focus on an economic aspect of it, leaving only 
principles of architecture and their application in a variety of cases. We discuss the capabilities of blockchain 
technology, operating principles of decentralized accounting systems and features of mechanisms for reaching consensus 
in a decentralized environment.

Our next goal is to create a "map" of decentralized technologies: their application areas, key processes, security, 
scalability, identity management, resource consumption and more.
