# About Distributed Lab

Distributed Lab’s mission is to make Financial Internet a reality. Society enjoys benefits that the modern Internet 
provides—from family entertainment and social networking to internet banking and global supply chains. However, 
processes in payments, trading, and management of ownership rights are still heavily paper-based, and as a consequence, 
they are slow, inefficient, cumbersome, and insecure. We envision the world where all assets are managed using 
accessible, secure, and open-source software with a uniform protocol.

Distributed Lab (https://distributedlab.com/) was founded in 2014 as an R&D company. We have been working on a wide 
variety of projects from wallets to digital banks, all operating in the field of accounting and management of assets.

We saw the potential that blockchain technology could bring to business operations and became extremely excited about 
it. At one point, we realized that we ought to spread the news about the bright future for one simple reason: it is 
impossible to create advanced systems without a proper education focused on the deep understanding of principles. 
That’s how we came up with a cornerstone of building the Financial Internet—through conducting research and knowledge 
sharing.

Our mission may seem too ambitious, but we believe that it can be achieved step by step. The closest goal is 
tokenization (digitization) of asset management systems. To make this happen, we have created a framework called TokenD 
(https://tokend.io/). It appeared as a consequence of years of work on different projects that, as we then realized, 
were essentially asking for the same thing. This “thing” is an accounting system which is secure, with wallets for 
users, a ledger for assets, an internal payment system, an exchange, modules that manage identities and roles, the 
lifecycle of assets, and gateways for external integrations. Having combined everything mentioned, TokenD allows one 
to launch a digital asset ecosystem within days for a fraction of the cost of the in-house development.

During the crazy hype period of 2017, we stayed calm and didn’t participate in any ICO while being focused on a search 
of real business value that blockchain can deliver. We commit ourselves to the long journey of transforming the world 
with technology.
