# [7 STABLECOINS AND DECENTRALIZED FINANCE](https://github.com/distributed-lab/blockchain-and-decentralized-systems-book/blob/main/chapters/volume-3/en/7-Stablecoins-and-decentralized-finance.md)

# CONCLUSION

When writing this book, we set ourselves a goal that may sound pretty simple: to create a map of decentralized technologies. However, this task is quite comprehensive and voluminous. It requires classifying the basic architectural solutions used for building decentralized systems and justifying the choice of specific components according to the threat model, the operational environment, the necessary properties, etc.

We attempted to show that blockchain technology is only the tip of the iceberg and it cannot solve all tasks set for a particular system. Each system is individual: it must solve a set of tasks for which it was designed. There are many different approaches to solve these problems, and we described them in our 3-volume book.

What is of higher priority when building an accounting system: capacity or decentralization level? How important are privacy and anonymity for users? How critical are node software requirements? Does a system need permissions, what they will be based on and who will set them? What about smart contracts? Should we prefer to use blockchain technology rather than to use another distributed ledger technology?

We set ourselves the goal to present the material in such a way that when answering these questions, the reader would know which technology can be applied in a particular case and how it can work with other components of the system. If you understand why a permissioned platform for physical asset (e.Â g., grain) tokenization does not need the mining mechanism, you have read the first part of the book for good reason. If you know what components you need to add to this platform to support atomic swaps with Bitcoin, you have learnt the second part well. If you also know the principles of hiding transaction details and how to synchronize your system with some other system, then we have achieved our goal.

An important thing to note is that no matter which version of the book you are holding in your hands at the moment, it is not final. We want to create the best book of its kind with the ability to constantly update it. And this is possible only thanks to its readers, their reviews and suggestions.
