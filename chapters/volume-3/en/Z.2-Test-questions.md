* _To hide the full route_
* _To protect against traffic blocking_

What is the peculiarity of garlic routing?  
* _Network participants unite in groups to hide from an outside observer the fact who sent or received the message_
* _A network node’s address is calculated as the hash value ​​of the last received message_
* _Messages are transmitted on the network not separately, but together with other messages for which a part of the path is the same_
* _Network participants receive rewards for updating the routing table_

What are the benefits of an I2P network?  
* _The sender of the message does not know the actual path of its transmission_
* _The recipient of the message does not know the actual path of its transmission_
* _Intermediate nodes do not know the entire transmission path of the message_
* _The sender and the recipient of the message do not know each other’s real addresses_

Which features does the messenger based on Tox protocol have?  
* _Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages if public keys are exchanged with reliably_
* _Hiding the connection between the users’ network addresses and accounts (public keys, Tox IDs)_
* _Every new message is sent to all network nodes, but only the recipient can decrypt it and find out who its sender is_
* _A message can be sent even if its recipient is offline_
