# Contribution and Use License Terms

These Contribution and Use License Terms (the **"Terms"**) apply to your Contribution (*as defined below*) to, and use 
of, the Work (*as defined below*). These Terms do not alter the terms of any other agreement you may have with Sakor (as 
defined below) for the Contribution to, or use, or both, of the Work (the **"Agreement"**). To the extent there is a 
conflict between any Agreement and these Terms, the terms of the relevant Agreement shall govern. The Terms are entered 
into between you and Sakor.

You must be 18 (eighteen) years or older to make the Contribution. If you are under 18 (eighteen) years of age, you are

the other agreement with Sakor, satisfactory to Sakor.

By making the Contribution to, or by using, or both, the Work, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted 
all the terms and conditions stipulated in these Terms and you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not 
agree to these Terms, please, do not make the Contribution and do not use the Work. You hereby acknowledge and agree
